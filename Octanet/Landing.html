            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Transport infrastructure consists of both fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and pipelines, and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fuel docks and fuel stations), and seaports. Terminals may be used both for the interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
            Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo. They may include vehicles, riding animals, and pack animals. Vehicles may include wagons, automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and aircraft.</p>

                    <h3>Roadways</h3>
                    <p>Connecting different cities and towns and even villages, roads serve a very important means for vehicles and people to travel from one place to another. Among the most common examples of land transport through roads are buses, trucks, motorcycles, rickshaws, and scooters.
                    Nowadays, modern and improved means of transport such as electric cars and scooters have also made their way in present-day modes of transport. Each of these modes of transport has a different passenger carrying capacity. Where a bus can carry up to fifty people in one trip, a scooter can allow maximum two to three people in one trip.</p>

                    <h3>Airways</h3>
                    <p>Airways refer to the passages through which air travels to and from the lungs during respiration. They can be categorized into the upper and lower airways:
                        1. Upper Airways:
                        Nasal Cavity: Filters, warms, and moistens air.
                        Pharynx: Throat region that serves both respiratory and digestive functions.
                        Larynx: Voice box; responsible for sound production and protecting the trachea against food aspiration.
                        2. Lower Airways:
                        Trachea: Windpipe; a tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi.
                        Bronchi: Two main branches from the trachea that lead into the lungs.
                        Bronchioles: Smaller branches of the bronchi within the lungs.</p>

                    <h3>Railways</h3>
                    <p>Railways, also known as railroads in some regions, are networks of tracks and infrastructure used for the transportation of passengers and goods. They are an essential component of many countries' transportation systems and have a significant impact on economic development, trade, and urban planning.
                        some of the components of railways are Tracks,Stations,Rolling Stock,Signaling system.Types of Railways:
                        1. Conventional Railways:
                        Passenger Trains: Designed for human transportation, ranging from local to long-distance services.
                        Freight Trains: Designed for carrying goods and cargo.
                        2. High-Speed Railways:
                        High-Speed Trains: Operate at speeds significantly higher than traditional rail, often exceeding 250 km/h (155 mph).
                        3. Urban Rail Systems:
                        Subways (Metro): Underground urban rail systems.
                        Trams (Streetcars): Light rail systems that often operate on streets.
                        4. Specialized Railways:
                        Monorails: Single rail systems, often used for short distances or amusement parks.
                        Maglev Trains: Use magnetic levitation for frictionless travel, enabling very high speeds.
